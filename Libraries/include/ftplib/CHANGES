The obligatory revision history...

Changes from V3.1-1 to V4.0

1) License changed from GPL/LGPL to Artistic License 2.0.

2) Many bugs reported over the years have been addressed.

3) The reentrant versions of gethostbyname and getservbyname are used
if available.

4) Internal buffers are larger which should allow for longer
filenames.

5) The library will not output anything to stdout or stderr unless
ftplib_debug is defined.

6) Some additional arguments are declared const.

7) The second argument to FtpSize is the address of an integer to
receive the size of the remote file.  The type of this argument has
been changed from int to unsigned int.  A new function, FtpSizeLong,
returns the remote file's size as an unsigned long long.

8) The second argument to the callback function has been changed from
an int to an unsigned long long.  This value contains the number of
bytes transferred so far.

9) The library version 1 interface compatability macros have been
removed from the header file.  If your application needs them, extract
them from the old header file.

10) The usage information in qftp.c has been corrected.

11) qftp now accepts a '-s <cmd>' option to send <cmd> as a SITE
command.

12) qftp progress reports now use floating point calculation so that
large numbers don't cause overflows.  If the remote server does not
support the SIZE command, qftp will update every 32KB.

13) A new type-safe method is provided to establish a callback
function.  Put the details of when the function should be called into
a FtpCallbackOptions structure and pass it to FtpSetCallback().  To
remove a callback, call FtpClearCallback().

14) Updated html documentation.

Changes from V3.1 to V3.1-1

1) Delay setting the control handle pointer in the data handle until
after the transfer request has received a positive acknowledgement.
This should resolve problems calling FtpClose() on the data handle
when the transfer is rejected.

2) Fix error handling in FtpRead() and FtpWrite().

3) Return status of transfer from FtpXfer() instead of status of
FtpClose().

4) Allow FtpClose() to be called on a control handle.  This should be
used instead of FtpQuit() in cases where a transfer was interrupted.
FtpQuit() would attempt to send a 'QUIT' command and wait for a
response but this would be out of sync after an interrupt.

5) The idle callback routine was not being set in the data handle if
the user didn't set FTPLIB_IDLETIME.  Fixed this so it would get set
up if either this or FTPLIB_CALLBACKBYTES was set.

6) Open local files in binary mode when appropriate.  This is
necessary on some systems like NT and VMS.

7) Added a wildcard mode to qftp for wildcard retrieves.  Argument
after '-w' is treated as a remote wildcard file specification.

Changes from 12/2/97 (V3) to .... (V3.1)

1) Added FtpPwd(), FtpSysType(), FtpCDUp(), FtpSize() and FtpModDate().

2) Fixed bug in FtpClose() - It wasn't waiting for the '226 Transfer
Complete' since it didn't have access to the control connection.  A
pointer to it is now kept in the data connection.

3) Fixed bug in FtpClose() - The data connection wasn't being freed.  This
could have resulted in memory leaks.

4) Allow runtime selection of connection mode (PORT/PASV) with default set
at compile time.

5) Added support for a user callback routine which can get called after a
user specified number of bytes are transferred or after waiting for data
on a socket for a user specified time period.

6) Add FtpOptions() which allows changing connection options.  Options
include connection mode, callback routine, and parameters regarding when
the user's callback routine gets called.

7) Added checks to make sure strcpy()/sprintf()/etc. wouldn't write past
end of buffers.

8) Modified build procedure to create a shared library.

9) Added install option to makefile which installs under /usr/local.

10) Modified qftp to use new interface.

11) Modified qftp to log progress every 10% of file or every time data
is delayd by 1 second if -v setting is not zero.

12) Modified qftp to use fgets() instead of gets().

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from 3/15/97 to 12/2/97

1) FtpLastResponse() returns NULL if passed a NULL pointer.

2) Added 'const' keyword on appropriate function arguments.

3) First attempt to translate passed host string as an IP address in dot
   notation by passing it to inet_addr().  If this fails, pass the string
   to gethostbyname().  Apparently, some versions of gethostbyname() will
   parse the translation of a dot notation address for you.  One user
   reports he knows of at least one that does not.  In any case, it's the
   right thing to do.

4) Added protection from double inclusion to header file.  Also added
   'extern "C"' for C++.

5) Made sure qftp was passed two arguments before examining the second
   one.

6) Made sure all commands to the server were in upper case.  I've been
   told that some servers require this.

7) Attempt to handle login to accounts with no passwords.

8) Added common data transfer routines so that ascii mode transfers would
   be handled properly in all cases.  Also, exposed these routines for
   user programs to call.  There's now FtpAccess() to open a remote file
   or directory, FtpRead() and FtpWrite() to pass data, and FtpClose() to
   terminate the data connection.

9) Added 'list' command to qftp to perform a terse directory (names
   only).  This could be piped into another copy of qftp to retrieve the
   files.

10) ftplib.c and ftplib.h are now covered by the LGPL instead of the GPL.
   Feel free to send me a complementary copy of anything you develop
   commercially with my libraries.  All other programs are still covered
   by the GPL.

11) Added ability to specify a different port number than the default by
   appending a colon and the desired port number to the remote host name
   (e.g., remote.host.name:500 would connect to port remote.host.name on
   port 500).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from 8/31/96 version to 3/15/97 version

1) Added copyright information to sources.

2) Changed from 'port' to 'pasv' which I'm told will allow the routines
   to work from behind a firewall.  It's also a lot simpler and cleaner
   than all that code to setup and accept a connect from the server.

3) Added delete (ftprm) support to qftp.c.

4) Modified qftp to allow use without a softlink by passing the ftp
   command as the first argument.

5) Added netbuf argument to all calls to eliminate static storage and
   allow multiple simultaneous connections.

6) Renamed routines from ftp*() to Ftp*() to avoid problems with existing
   programs.  Added macros in libftp.h to support old interface.  Renamed
   ftpOpen() to FtpConnect().
